The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a 2003 epicfantasy-drama film directed by Peter Jackson based on the second and third volumes of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.
Released on 17 December 2003, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King received rave reviews and became one of the greatest critical and box-office successes of all time, being only the second film to gross $1 billion worldwide, becoming the highest grossing film from New Line Cinema, as well as the biggest financial success for Time Warner in general, until Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows â€“ Part 2 surpassed The Return of the King's final gross in 2011. 
It was the highest-grossing film of 2003.
The Lord of the Rings film trilogy is unusual in that it was, up until the release of Jacksons prequel trilogy The Hobbit, the only series whose separate installments were written and shot simultaneously (excluding pick up shoots). 
Jackson found The Return of the King the easiest of the films to make, because it contained the climax of the story, unlike the other two films.
